This is a kata done based on the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jameskbride/5482722">instructions here</a>

Please run the tests in BabysitterTest in order to verify the functionality is built. The calculatePay method in Babysitter takes DateTime objects for the start, end, and bedtime and will give either an exception if the input is invalid or the correct amount that the babysitter should be payed for the time worked.

Future enhancements with this could be to allow fractional hours, to build a UI, and to add further validation around invalid dates and times for the input.
